#+TITLE: My Configuration Files

This repository holds my config files (apart from my .emacs which lives
[[https://github.com/georgek/dot-emacs][here]]).

* Usage

I find it convenient to use GNU stow to make symlinks to files in this repo.
For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone <this> ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  stow bash
#+END_SRC

Now everything inside bash is symlinked from the directory above ~/.dotfiles.

Inspired by [[https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/][this post]].

* Sway

I am currently transitioning from i3 to sway. The sway config is almost the
same as the i3 config and i3blocks works the same way.

Current issues:

- .Xresources should be copied to .Xdefaults so that things like xterm work
  properly,
- vaapi doesn't work due to a problem in the latest libva. There is apparently
  a patch but it is not yet released:
  https://github.com/intel/intel-vaapi-driver/issues/419
- mpv wayland output doesn't work,
- Firefox wayland output is buggy (menus flicker)
